# overview:
Currently we have pre-patches throughout the pilot network that are not being efficiently tracked.
Spreadsheets are out of date the day after they are made, as are any external, unlinked notes.

We can easily view pre-patch capacity with loaded filtered searches, but currently only two people at Pilot can do so.
This plugin will be a very simple dashboard that displays  pre-patch capacity by site.

We currently track pre-patches by the native netbox tagging, so this is not a far strecth by any means.

For the notes on active development, check dan's github, they will be placed here as development progresses.

# basic structure of plugin:
We will be heavily following the official docs on this, since it needs to be readable for everyone else.
